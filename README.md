# Servo Motors

# Overview
This project is a simple electronics circuit designed using Tinkercad to control the movement of four servo motors using an Arduino Uno R3 board. The motors work simultaneously in a sweeping motion for two seconds, and then they all stop and hold at a 90-degree angle.

# Features
- Programmed Motion: The code executes a sweeping motion for all motors and then holds them at a 90-degree angle.
- Tinkercad Simulation: The entire circuit can be simulated online without the need for physical components.

# Technologies & Components
- Tinkercad
- Hardware Components:
  - Arduino Uno R3
  - 4 x Servo Motors
  
# Viewing and Simulation
You can view and simulate the complete project on the Tinkercad platform by using the link provided in the repository's "About" section. This will allow you to interact with the circuit, view the code, and understand its full functionality.

# Walking Algorithm for Humanoid Robot
- Robot stands straight.
- Robot shifts weight to the left leg and lifts the right leg with the knee bent.
- Robot moves the right leg forward, straightens the knee, and puts the leg down.
- Robot shifts weight to the right leg and lifts the left leg with the knee bent.
- Robot moves the left leg forward, straightens the knee, and puts the leg down.
- Repeat for walking.
