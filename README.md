# Servo Motors

# Overview
This project is a simple electronics circuit designed using Tinkercad to control the movement of four servo motors using an Arduino Uno R3 board. The motors work simultaneously in a sweeping motion for two seconds, and then they all stop and hold at a 90-degree angle.

# Features
- Programmed Motion: The code executes a sweeping motion for all motors and then holds them at a 90-degree angle.
- Tinkercad Simulation: The entire circuit can be simulated online without the need for physical components.

# Technologies & Components
- Tinkercad
- Hardware Components:
  - Arduino Uno R3
  - 4 x Servo Motors
  
# Viewing and Simulation
